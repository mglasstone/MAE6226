      "Potential flow theory has a range of useful applications, many of which have been covered already in MAE6226. The backbone of potential flow theory is  the principle of superposition. This allows for complex geometries to be analyzed by adding together the solutions of simpler geometries. This allows us to apply potential flow for everything from the visualization of flow over a cylinder to finding the lift of an airfoil.\n",

      "\n",
      "Said best by John von Neumann, the result of these assumptions is that the flow is \"so unphysical that the only fluid to obey the assumptions is 'Dry Water'\". Using clever math, the incompressible fluid assumption can be relaxed at low to moderate Mach numbers. By reducing the number of assumptions, the \"realism\" of the modelled flows can be increased.
